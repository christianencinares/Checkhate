2. Change the directory to the project's root directory
3. Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`:

```
4. You may encounter problems installing wordcloud. If that happens, follow these steps:

    - Download the .whl file compatible with your Python version and your windows distribution (32bit or 64bit) [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#wordcloud)
    - Change your directory to the path containing the downloaded .whl file
    - Run this command, replacing `<filename>` to the name of the .whl file previously downloaded (e.g. `wordcloud‑1.8.1‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl`):
  
    ```cmd
    > python -m pip install <filename>
    ```
